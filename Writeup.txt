The libraries used are the following: 
 - math
 - colorama
 - termcolor
 - numpy
 
The frameworks used was based on the Mancala project in class in terms of having or building up to
 - display function
 - variable board sizing
 - aimagames Minimax 
 
Our testing so far has confirmed the following functionality
 - Board
     - Display
        * We can verify visually that display corresponds to correct boardstate
     - Correct coordinate notation
        * We can verify visually that display corresponds to correct boardstate
     - Gameplay
        * We can play a game that abides by the modified rules
     - Harmony 
     - Win condition checking
        * We create board states in which there should be a win and see there are wins.
     - Harmony chain checking
        * We form harmonies and check internally if the harmonies actually go off.
 - Action
     - Player input
        * We can play a game
     - Placing pieces
     - Removing pieces
     - Moving pieces
         - Legally moving existing pieces
            * Not only can we individually verify legal move placement by manually inputting moves, but also the legal move checker seems to work with the AI.
         - Legally placing pieces
            * Not only can we individually verify legal move placement by manually inputting moves, but also the legal move checker seems to work with the AI.
         - Capturing pieces
            * Pieces seem to get captured in accordance to expected behavior in AI testing and manual player testing.
 - AI
     - Minimax
         - Evaluation function
             * The harmony chains and piece placement are giving manually verifiable utility
             - Harmony chain checking
                * The harmony chains are giving manually verifiable utility
     - Random Gameplay
        * Gameplay of a player vs the random gameplay seems to be playing legal moves and identifies all possible moves.



The following are functionalities to test but haven't been fully implemented or functionalities that are to be implemented with more progress.
 - Alpha Beta (Requires "Minimax" to work.)
